<p>Student’s t-test is a technique for assessing a specific <em>hypothesis</em>. In this case: <em>are the population average decisions times of males different from the population average decision times of females?</em></p>
<p>Let’s call the population average decision times of males <span class="math inline">\(\mu_m\)</span>, and the population average decision times of females <span class="math inline">\(\mu_f\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our <em>null</em> hypothesis is that there is <strong>no difference</strong> between these population averages, so</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_0: \mu_m - \mu_f = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>The <em>alternative</em> hypothesis is what must be true if the null is not true. For us, this is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_1: \mu_m - \mu_f \neq 0
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that we make a hypothesis about the <strong>population</strong>. We don’t know what the population actually is, and all we have is a <strong>sample</strong>. The t-test uses that sample data in order to draw inference about the population.</p>
