Student's t-test is a technique for assessing a specific *hypothesis*. In this case: *are the population average decisions times of males different from the population average decision times of females?* 

Let's call the population average decision times of males $\mu_m$, and the population average decision times of females $\mu_f$. 

Our *null* hypothesis is that there is **no difference** between these population averages, so

$$
H_0: \mu_m - \mu_f = 0
$$

The *alternative* hypothesis is what must be true if the null is not true. For us, this is:

$$
H_1: \mu_m - \mu_f \neq 0
$$

Notice that we make a hypothesis about the **population**. We don't know what the population actually is, and all we have is a **sample**. The t-test uses that sample data in order to draw inference about the population.
