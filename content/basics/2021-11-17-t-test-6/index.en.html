<p>Should we reject the null hypothesis that the population average decision times with time pressure are the same for males and females?</p>
<p>The t-test permits us to ask the a specific question: <strong>If the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of observing a value the same, or more extreme, than the test statistic that we observed in our sample?</strong></p>
<p>If this probability is <em>low</em> we will <em>reject the null hypothesis</em>: we will essentially decide that this observed statistic is different enough that we would not attribute this difference to sampling error alone.</p>
<p>Now, because the t-distribution is a probability distribution, the total <em>area below the t-distribution</em> is 1.</p>
<p>So we need to decide what <em>level of significance</em> we are comfortable with first, and then we can determine the probability that our observed test statistic could be as extreme or more so that what we just observed.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value of our test statistic is the area towards the nearest <em>tail</em></p>
